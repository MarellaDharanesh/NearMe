<b><br>About Hosur Bus Stand:</br>
    <br> </br>
In the early 1980s, the bus station was built and named after former MLA and Hosur town panchayat president Mr. K. Appavu Pillai. In 2007 due to the National Highway road expansion, the bus terminus was reconstructed, costing 6.80-10.5 crores. The new terminus was again named after Pillai and inaugurated by M. K. Stalin on 18 July 2010.
